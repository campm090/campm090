- 👋 Hi, I’m @campm090, or 'Peter' to humans.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... why you of course, and why you are looking here - do tell
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... changes with Git et al, selections of Qlik stuff, Denodo and related, no-code coding with Power BI, and other magical thinking . . . 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... just so many things to be doing, and all so very interesting
- 📫 How to reach me ... you already have!
- 😄 Pronouns: ... I respond to most
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was an Gamesmaker at the London Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012, and I still have the shirt (somewhere)
- :-)
